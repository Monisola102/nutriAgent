## Nutrition Agent: Food Analysis and Health Insights using USDA API

This project provides a Nutrition Agent that fetches nutritional information, vitamins, minerals, and health benefits for any food using the USDA FoodData Central API.  
It uses a custom Mastra tool (`foodInfoTool`) to retrieve and format the data.  
Optional workflows can orchestrate multi-step processing for input validation, enrichment, and output formatting.  
The agent is designed for easy integration in chatbots, web apps, or other AI-powered interfaces.
